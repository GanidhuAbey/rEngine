[Terms to Learn]
    Physical Device
        - (S) specifies the current hardware (GPU) of the computer being used

    Graphics Queue
        - (NS) a queue that manages the render calls being given to the GPU, multiple queues can be active allowing for multiple draw calls to be completed at once
    
    Surface
        - (NS) defines the area where the GPU can render too

    Device
        - (NS) A way to specify to vulkan the settings that our window will have

    Image buffer
        - (S) A space of memory designated to hold the current image being worked on (rendered, changed, etc)

    Swapchain
        - (NS) A list of image buffers that will eventually be displayed to the user (like pixels i guess)
    
    Vertex
        - (S) A point in a 3d coodinate system

    gl_Position
        - (S) A global builtin variable for the GLSL lanuage, essential in creating a shader as it stores the location of the current
            vertex.
    Layers
        - (NS) A set of planes that can be drawn on within the window
    
    Shaders
        - (NS) The shader takes in all the inputs of a vertex that is needed to display to the screen (colour, position, etc) and
            uses it to output the final position of that given vertex.

    Render Pass
        - (NS) An object that shows where the render output will go

    Graphics Pipeline
        - (NS) Where we can tell the computer to render to the screen?

    Arc
        - (NS) A pointer for values on the heap such that when any value is cloned it creats a new pointer that also points
        to the original data.
    
    Samples
        - (NS) Tells the computer whether or not we're multisampling. multisampling is the proccess of making and image look
        smoother

[Important for our Engine]
    Multiple Graphics Queues
        - Need to have multiple queues to make our draw calls more efficient and our game engine faster

[Stuff to Remember]
    vulkano::device::DeviceExtensions::supported_by_device()
        - prob will be good to just plug this in so i don't have to figure out what all of the settings do exactly

[Questiosn]
    How do you implement a device for multiple queues?
        - It seems as if it doesn't matter if you input more than one queue into the device
